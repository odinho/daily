Daily
-----

Time keeping and a few other helpful-ish things.

Not really meant to be useful for others, but WFM.

First time
----------

- You need to set your EDITOR env var (some extra features if
  that's "vim").
- Normally you'd start your day with a new project, say "mom" if you're
  working for your mom:

  daily mom # will log you in
  daily mom # when you're finished working, will open your editor
- It will store its files in `~/.local/daily/` (since that makes sense
  for Linux)
- You can watch how much you've worked for mom by doing:
  daily -t mom (or daily --time mom)
- `daily -p mom` creates your plan file
- `daily -e mom` opens the mom time project, and plan file if you have it
- `daily -l` brings up your daily notepad
- `daily -m` your morning file

Your time file will probably look like this in the end:
```
$ daily --view mom

07-May-2018: 1800-2352
+ mowed lawn
+ ate chocolate
* moms cookies website

06-May-2018: 1659-2300
* moms cookies website

26-Nov-2017: 2300-0005
* started on moms cookies website
```

The format of what you write under each day can be what you
want for now.
