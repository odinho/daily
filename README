Daily
-----

Time keeping and a few other helpful-ish things.

Not really meant to be useful for others, but WFM.

First time
----------

- You need to set your EDITOR env var (some extra features if
  that's "vim").
- Normally you'd start your day with a new project, say "mom" if you're
  working for your mom:

  daily mom # will log you in
  daily mom # when you're finished working, will open your editor
- It will store its files in `~/.local/daily/` (since that makes sense
  for Linux)
- You can watch how much you've worked for mom by doing:
  daily -t mom (or daily --time mom)
- `daily -p mom` creates your plan file
- `daily -e mom` opens the mom time project, and plan file if you have it
- `daily -l` brings up your daily notepad
- `daily -m` your morning file

Your time file will probably look like this in the end:
```
$ daily --view mom

07-May-2018: 1800-2352
+ mowed lawn
+ ate chocolate
* moms cookies website

06-May-2018: 1659-2300
* moms cookies website

26-Nov-2017: 2300-0005
* started on moms cookies website
```

The format of what you write under each day can be what you
want for now.

Usage
-----

    usage: daily [-h] [-e] [-v] [-t] [-m] [-l] [-g] [-o] [rest [rest ...]]

    positional arguments:
      rest

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help       show this help message and exit
      -e, --edit
      -v, --view
      -t, --time
      -m, --morning
      -l, --log
      -p, --plan
      -g, --grep
      -o, --open-file

Reports
-------

Not a lot of reports, you have to write them yourself or just hack the
script. But there is a time report that I use to count the hours to bill
clients:

```
$ daily -t dad
05-Apr-2017 03:00:00 146m
06-Apr-2017 02:00:00 100m
mom2: 4h 6m (0.1w / 0.5d, normalized: 5.0h / 0.1w / 0.7d)
--- (^- paid)

12-Mar-2024 01:00:00  60m
dad: 1h 0m (0.0w / 0.1d, normalized: 1.0h / 0.0w / 0.1d)
```

You just write three hyphens `---` on its own line to delimit sections
from eachother. Every section will get printed with its own summary line
and the "(^- paid)" text to show why it is its own section.
